3.1 convex-hull
===============

 -- Scheme Procedure: convex-hull points
     Generate a convex hull of a set of xy* points.  POINTS should be a
     list of x/y point-vectors: '(#(x y ...)  #(x y ...)  ...  #(x y
     ...))

     This procedure runs AMC-CONVEX-HULL

     Returns the hull as list of x/y point-vectors.

 -- Scheme Procedure: amc-convex-hull points
     Implements Andrew's monotone chain algorithm.  O(n log n)
     complexity.  POINTS is a list of point-vectors '(#(x .  y) #(x .
     y) ...  #(x .y)).

     Returns the x/y points that make up the hull as a list of
     point-vectors.

 -- Scheme Procedure: pw-convex-hull points
     Implements a package-wrap algorithm to discover the convex hull of
     a set of points.  POINTS is a list of point-vectors '(#(x .  y) #(x
     .  y) ...  #(x .y)).

     Returns the x/y points that make up the hull as a list of x/y
     point-vectors.

5 Examples
**********

Use the hull script to discover a hull from a set of xyz points in the
file data.xyz and output the hull to the file data.hull:

   $ hull data.xyz -f > data.hull
